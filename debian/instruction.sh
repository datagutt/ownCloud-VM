| If you never done this before you can follow the complete             |
| install instructions: https://goo.gl/3FYtz6                           |
|                                                                       |
| You can also set the ownCloud update process as a cronjob.            |
| This is made thru the built in script in this VM that                 |
| updates ownCloud, set secure permissions, and then                    |
| logs the successful update in /var/log/cronjobs_success.log           |
| Here is a guide on how to set it up:                                  |
